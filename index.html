    <h1>CSL Behring UK Ltd. PRIVACY NOTICE</h1>
    <h2>
      for the bePROactive Application (Patient Reported Outcome App)
    </h2>
    <h3>
      What happens to information which you enter into the PRO App?
    </h3>
    <p>
        The information that you enter into the bePROactive App provided by us,
        CSL Behring UK Ltd., is “personal data” because it is information that
        relates to a person who is, or who could be, identified. The information
        which you enter into the bePROactive App about your symptoms constitutes
        personal data concerning your health, which is sensitive. Your personal
        data (whether sensitive or not) is stored only on your device. The
        bePROactive App does not transmit your personal data anywhere, nor make
        it accessible to us or to anyone else. We will receive statistics on the
        number of times the bePROactive App is downloaded. Those statistics will
        not include any information relating to any individual users of the App.
        The bePROactive App enables you to generate a pdf file containing the
        information which you entered. If you wish to share that file with your
        consultant or anyone else, you could do so by attaching it to an email
        and sending it using the email service which is native to your device.
        As the pdf attachment will not be encrypted, it could be intercepted and
        read by a third party. Considering that the information contains health
        data,you should consider carefully whether you wish to send it this way.
        You are not obliged to enter your information into the bePROactive App,
        nor to share with anyone the pdf file which it generates containing the
        information which you entered into the App.
        You may not use the bePROactive App if you are under 13 years of age,
        but you may have your parent or guardian use it on your behalf.
